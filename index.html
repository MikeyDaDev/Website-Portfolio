    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the portfolio of Michael Mcneill! I am an aspiring web developer with a passion for creating interactive and functional websites. I'm eager to learn developing and designing to give users an immersive experience when using my future creations. Currently in the process of transferring from the University of Phoenix majoring in Cybersecurity to major in Engineering Tech at University of Maryland Eastern Shore. I wanted to gain on-hands experience to help me build tech devices and software. I want to use my learning to build websites, apps and potentially help design games.</p>
